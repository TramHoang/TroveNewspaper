# Production Journal
For the final assignment for Designing for Data-Informed User Experience, I have been tasked to create a website program using GLAM Data and participated in a group project. For the rationale, I will divide into two parts - individual project and group project in general. I will talk about the process as well as the problem that I encounter while doing the projects. Finally, I will conclude what I have learned from doing the project and what can I do differently if I meet similar projects again.

##### Individual Project
To achieve the requirement for the project, I created a website using Trove API and called - Trove API newspaper. The basic function of the website is searching newspaper from the user input and return the results of the newspaper contained the keyword. The results also included the date of publishing, the summary and the link to the paper. It took me 4 weeks to finish the whole project.

**1. The Process**
I spent the whole first week to do research about GLAM data as well as brainstorming the idea for my program. I decided to choose Trove API because it has well documents online and many tutorials about how to use Trove API. Then, I started to design the interface and draw wireframe. I used [Google](https://www.google.com/) as the original idea of developing an interface for my program because my program is also a search engine. Therefore, I want to create a neat and straightforward layout.

After that, I chose the primary colour for the website. The colour is light golden colour as it creates an old newspaper vibe and aligns to my main program function. My first interface is somewhat similar to Google; hence, I added JavaScript function to make it more interactive to the user. By clicking on the screen, the user can make the search bar appear or disappear on the screen. During this stage, everything worked well for me, and there were no major problems happen.

**2. The Problems and how I solve it**
There are two main problems I encountered when doing the project is to get the search word and get/retrieve information from the Trove API. To solve these issues, I asked Ben to help me to fix it. Based on his solution, I modified a bit of the code to make it suitable for my purposes. Overall, these two steps consumed most of my time to be able to make it work. I had to re-read the documents, watch tutorials as well as do the research again not only on API but also JavaScript coding in general. Finally, I succeed to use API and retrieve the information as I planned. However, there are still some minor errors in displaying the results that I have not to be able to fix it, such as the text line is overwritten outside the box on the displaying sections. Also, I have not made the URL from the results link back to the Trove website. In my opinion, the reason for these errors is I have not put them in the form style or writing the wrong code to append it correctly. Even until now, I still can not be able to fix the errors. 


##### Group Project
**1. The Process**
In the group project, we have to create a website to display all the members’ projects. By using Trello, we divided works to each other, and my part is doing CSS for the website. This is the tool to help us keep track of the tasks as well as communicate with other members. Overall, we have 5 stages: from basic setup GitHub, design prototype, creating HTML file, doing CSS to checking and finalise the project. In this project, Kim is the leader of the group, and he did a great job of connecting all members together. He always checks and makes sure our progress is up to date and on time. Stefanie and David are the first two people to set up Github and design the draft interface. My part is the stage 4 in the project. At my stage, I already had all the materials that I needed to do my part. Based on the interface draft, I applied the design to the website. All the code in HTML file were marked up and commented carefully by Sarah, so it did not take too much time for me to allocate the position. However, the CSS process did take time for me to do as I had to modify and fix the layout to make it appeal and match with our initial design. Tanaya is the final member to test the quality and checking the content. We have done a great job as a team as this is shown in our final production. The reason we can conduct a good result because the works are divided equally, and each member knew what to do with their part.

**2. The problem and how I solve**
In my opinion, I think communication is the major issues we have in the project since we did not have many technical issues while doing the website. Our primary communication tools are Trello, and the discussion group on Canvas. Sometimes, it took me a long time to keep up with the chatbox because the group switched the conversation between Canvas and Trello a lot. Therefore, I kept track with the group mostly based on the deadline that we assigned each other on each stage on Trello. After finishing my stage, I kept up to date with other members’ comment and modified the layout according to the approval opinion.
##### Conclusion
By doing this project, I have a chance to revive my knowledge I learned before about coding for the design. Besides, I learned several new APIs, the function of each API and how to use it for a particular purpose. Next time when I did a similar API project, it will not take too much time for me in researching APIs, and I will be more confident in working with API. Furthermore, I have an opportunity to collaborate with all the students in the class for the group website, which helps me to gain more experience in group work. The thing I will fix next time for group work is to have one tool for communication. Having more than one communication tool make our progress to be inconsistent and time-consuming. In conclusion, the assignment has provided meaningful experiences for me as an undergraduate student when it comes to developing a service project.
